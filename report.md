# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 41](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L41)

	```solidity
	contract DecentralizedStableCoin is ERC20Burnable, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 56](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L56)

	```solidity
	    function burn(uint256 _amount) public override onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol [Line: 67](src/DecentralizedStableCoin.sol#L67)

	```solidity
	    function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyOwner returns (bool) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operation

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 613](src/DSCEngine.sol#L613)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountCollateral);
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 660](src/DSCEngine.sol#L660)

	```solidity
	        bool success = IERC20(tokenCollateralAddress).transfer(to, amountCollateral);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 2](src/Counter.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 7](src/Counter.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
	```

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 11](src/Counter.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    function increment() public {
	```

- Found in src/libraries/OracleLib.sol [Line: 20](src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#L20)

	```solidity
	    function staleCheckLatestRoundData(AggregatorV3Interface chainlinkFeed)
	```

- Found in src/libraries/OracleLib.sol [Line: 37](src/libraries/OracleLib.sol#L37)

	```solidity
	    function getTimeout(
	```

</details>



## L-5: `nonReentrant` is Not the First Modifier

To protect against reentrancy in other modifiers, the `nonReentrant` modifier should be the first modifier in the list of modifiers.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 447](src/DSCEngine.sol#L447)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 503](src/DSCEngine.sol#L503)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 566](src/DSCEngine.sol#L566)

	```solidity
	    function mintDsc(uint256 amountDscToMint) public moreThanZero(amountDscToMint) nonReentrant {
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 603](src/DSCEngine.sol#L603)

	```solidity
	        nonReentrant
	```

</details>



## L-6: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

	```solidity
	pragma solidity 0.8.20;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Unused State Variable

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inline assembly references it. Consider removing this unused variable.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 220](src/DSCEngine.sol#L220)

	```solidity
	    uint256 private constant FEED_PRECISION = 1e8;
	```

</details>



## L-8: Storage Array Length not Cached

Calling `.length` on a storage array in a loop condition is expensive. Consider caching the length in a local variable in memory before the loop and reusing it.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 892](src/DSCEngine.sol#L892)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 index = 0; index < s_collateralTokens.length; index++) {
	```

</details>



## L-9: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>4 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 7](src/Counter.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
	```

- Found in src/Counter.sol [Line: 11](src/Counter.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    function increment() public {
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 466](src/DSCEngine.sol#L466)

	```solidity
	    function burnDsc(uint256 amount) external moreThanZero(amount) {
	```

- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 566](src/DSCEngine.sol#L566)

	```solidity
	    function mintDsc(uint256 amountDscToMint) public moreThanZero(amountDscToMint) nonReentrant {
	```

</details>



## L-10: State Variable Could Be Immutable

State variables that are only changed in the constructor should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/DSCEngine.sol [Line: 275](src/DSCEngine.sol#L275)

	```solidity
	    address[] private s_collateralTokens;
	```
